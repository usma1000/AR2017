<p>When severe childhood asthma forced Linda Burnes Bolton into frequent medical care, the compassion shown by nurses helped her recover.</p>
<p>It also pointed her toward a career in caregiving.</p>
<p>Now a university trustee and vice president of nursing at Los Angeles’ Cedars-Sinai Health System, Burnes Bolton has achieved such national renown that she is called on regularly to contribute her expertise on critical health issues.</p>
<p>The most recent example involves opiates, where she joined Case Western Reserve faculty member Lee Hoffer on an expert committee providing analysis and recommendations for easing the epidemic.</p>
<p>Convened by The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, the group issued a 482-page report in July that calls for expanding access to treatment, increasing  research and encouraging more responsible prescribing among health care providers. The report found that, as of 2015, about 2 million people have a “use disorder” involving prescription opioids, and 600,000 have the disorder relating to heroin.</p>
<p>“Data from the front lines, so to speak, helps policymakers be better informed to fix this issue,” Hoffer said.</p>
<p>As an anthropologist whose research focuses on heroin, Hoffer is all too familiar with the havoc the drug can wreak.</p>
<p>As he came to know some heroin users, Hoffer detailed the everyday experiences of their condition as a way to humanize the problem for the public.</p>
<p>As Burnes Bolton explains, “caring about others means doing what you can, no matter who you are.”</p>
